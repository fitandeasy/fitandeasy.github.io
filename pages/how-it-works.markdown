## Power Plate - Southampton

The Power Plate® is a gently vibrating platform. Stand on the Power Plate® and immediately your muscles begin to contract and relax up to fifty times a second – this is Acceleration Training™. By holding certain positions whilst on the platform, specific body areas can be targeted to develop muscle tone and create definition.

Twenty minutes is all you need and because no exertion is required, Power Plate ® users rarely perspire so there’s no need to change, just kick-off your shoes!
