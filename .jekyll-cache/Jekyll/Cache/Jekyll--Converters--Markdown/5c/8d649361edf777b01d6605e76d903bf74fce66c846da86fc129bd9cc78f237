					<h2>Power Plate - Southampton</h2>

<p>The Power Plate® is a gently vibrating platform. Stand on the Power Plate® and immediately your muscles begin to contract and relax up to fifty times a second – this is Acceleration Training™. By holding certain positions whilst on the platform, specific body areas can be targeted to develop muscle tone and create definition.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes is all you need and because no exertion is required, Power Plate ® users rarely perspire so there’s no need to change, just kick-off your shoes!</p>

				<p>Engineered precisely to apply the body’s natural reflexive response to vibration, Power Plate technology uses a vibrating platform, which moves 25 to 50 times per second, resulting in corresponding muscle activation. The vibrations are harmonic, which are safe, consistent and controlled levels of vibration, moving in three directions (up and down, forwards and backwards and side to side).</p>

				<p>Significant weight loss is often reported by those who use Power Plate regularly in conjunction with a healthy, calorie-controlled diet. One of the reasons for this is increased lymphatic flow and associated removal of biological waste, and retained fluid. Research shows, when used as part of an active lifestyle, Power Plate may have a significant impact upon the reduction of body fat. This may occur due to increases in metabolism both during and following exercise.</p>

				<p>We advise everyone to contact their physician or specialist before using Power Plate and recommend they do not start training without first obtaining medical clearance to exercise. If you are currently active, cleared for exercise, and perform weight-bearing exercises, such as weight training or jogging, you are likely to be a good candidate for training on Power Plate. However, every person should be examined on an individual basis by a licensed medical practitioner. As with any form of exercise, if you feel faint, dizzy or ill while working out on Power Plate, you should cease your session immediately. Consult your doctor or specialist before restarting your training.</p>

				<p>As with most forms of training, Power Plate will generate fatigue in the body. This fatigue is what stimulates the body to adapt and develop, but too much training results in excessive fatigue and over–training. As a very general guide we would suggest two to three training sessions per week, each lasting between 15 and 30 minutes and leaving 48 to 72 hours for recovery between sessions. We recommend you seek advice from a certified Power Plate trainer prior to your first session.</p>
