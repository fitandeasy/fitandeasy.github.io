<p>The Power Plate® is a gently vibrating platform. Stand on the Power Plate® and immediately your muscles begin to contract and relax up to fifty times a second – this is Acceleration Training™. By holding certain positions whilst on the platform, specific body areas can be targeted to develop muscle tone and create definition.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes is all you need and because no exertion is required, Power Plate ® users rarely perspire so there’s no need to change, just kick-off your shoes!</p>
