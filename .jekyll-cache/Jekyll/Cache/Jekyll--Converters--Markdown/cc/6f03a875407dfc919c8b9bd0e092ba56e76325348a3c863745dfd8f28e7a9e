<p>The Power Plate® is a gently vibrating platform. Stand on the Power Plate® and immediately your muscles begin to contract and relax up to fifty times a second – this is Acceleration Training™. By holding certain positions whilst on the platform, specific body areas can be targeted to develop muscle tone and create definition.</p>

<p>Twenty minutes is all you need and because no exertion is required, Power Plate ® users rarely perspire so there’s no need to change, just kick-off your shoes!</p>

        <p class="first-row-why-copy2">Many traditional exercises can be done on the Power Plate, and the results are
            magnified. It’s thanks to our proprietary PrecisionWave™ Technology, which is engineered precisely to
            activate the body’s natural reflexive response to vibration. The surface vibrates 25 to 50 times per second
            (25Hz to 50Hz), resulting in a natural response that works your muscles harder while doing the same
            exercises. </p>

        <h4 class="first-row-why-copy1">POWER PLATE CAN HELP YOU LOSE WEIGHT</h4>
        <p class="first-row-why-copy2">Significant weight loss is often reported by those who use Power Plate regularly in conjunction with a healthy, calorie-controlled diet. One of the reasons for this is increased lymphatic flow. Research also shows, when used as part of an active lifestyle, Power Plate may have a significant impact upon the reduction of cellulite and body fat. This may occur due to an increases in metabolism, both during and following exercise.

        <h4 class="first-row-why-copy1">INCREASE YOUR STRENGTH AND FLEXIBILITY</h4>
        <p class="first-row-why-copy2">The Power Plate vibrates up and down, side-to-side, and front-to-back, destabilizing the body and promoting the reflexive engagement of soft tissue. Involuntary muscle activity promotes quick, reflexive responses in muscle fibers and an increase in circulation. That means development in whole–body balance, mobility and stability, strength and motor control (muscle memory), in a shorter time frame than with traditional methods.

        <h4 class="first-row-why-copy1">YOU'LL RECOVER FASTER</h4>
        <p class="first-row-why-copy2">Exercise is stress, and the body needs time to rebuild to positively adapt to training. Massage on a Power Plate stimulates lymphatic flush, eases pain, promotes faster recovery of damaged muscles and tendons, improves joint function, and helps you return stronger–all in only a few minutes a day. And even beyond that, you can exercise using a Power Plate with less chance of strain due to the patented multi–directional vibration. With regular use, you’ll find that you prepare faster, perform better and recover quicker.

				<p>Engineered precisely to apply the body’s natural reflexive response to vibration, Power Plate technology uses a vibrating platform, which moves 25 to 50 times per second, resulting in corresponding muscle activation. The vibrations are harmonic, which are safe, consistent and controlled levels of vibration, moving in three directions (up and down, forwards and backwards and side to side).</p>

				<p>We advise everyone to contact their physician or specialist before using Power Plate and recommend they do not start training without first obtaining medical clearance to exercise. If you are currently active, cleared for exercise, and perform weight-bearing exercises, such as weight training or jogging, you are likely to be a good candidate for training on Power Plate. However, every person should be examined on an individual basis by a licensed medical practitioner. As with any form of exercise, if you feel faint, dizzy or ill while working out on Power Plate, you should cease your session immediately. Consult your doctor or specialist before restarting your training.</p>

				<p>As with most forms of training, Power Plate will generate fatigue in the body. This fatigue is what stimulates the body to adapt and develop, but too much training results in excessive fatigue and over–training. As a very general guide we would suggest two to three training sessions per week, each lasting between 15 and 30 minutes and leaving 48 to 72 hours for recovery between sessions. We recommend you seek advice from a certified Power Plate trainer prior to your first session.</p>
